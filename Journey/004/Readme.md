# Express Route - Part 1

## Introduction

In every large organisation, the most common networking compontent that they do use is ExpressRoute. Its Day 4 and I want to explore ExpressRoute indepth and identify what is it and how do we actually use it! 

ExpressRoute allows organisation to extend its on-premises network into the Microsoft Cloud over private connection with the help of a service provider. 

## Background

Lets understand a few things before we dive deep into ExpressRoute:

*The MS Backbone*
- Private network that interconnects Microsoft's data centers worldwide and provides the underlying connectivity for various Microsoft services, including Azure, Microsoft 365, and other cloud-based offerings.

Throughout the world there are edge nodes like Azure FrontDoor and the point of these edge nodes they bring computing resources closer to the users or device. 

Each edge site is a physical location where multiple edge nodes / servers distributed across different geographic locations.   
  
Each edge site, we will be connecting to different carriers such as Optus / Vodafone. The idea is as a customer, we get a service from a service provider. We would only be one hop away to a direct connection to Microsoft.  
  
Edge site, connect on-premises to the internet through the carriers.
